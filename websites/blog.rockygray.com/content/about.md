I am a systems engineer with about a decade of experience in architecture and data engineering. I am currently leading
teams at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) building APIs using microservices written in Node, Go, and Java and
managing the Kubernetes infrastructure that supports them. I have led teams at [Storyblocks](https://www.storyblocks.com/),
a DC area startup where I picked up e-comm experience, some video and image encoding tricks, and how to build up an
awesome engineering and company culture.

Outside of work I am a husband to the brilliant [Ashley Gray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-a-gray-4b055356/), dad
of 2 awesome boys, and a weekend athlete with aging ankles and knees that loves to play basketball. I am committed to
increasing the representation of Blacks in the tech industry and helping them be successful once they are in.
