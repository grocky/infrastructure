This is the first blog post. My goal is to write at least one post per month, but I'm hoping to write much more
frequently. I don't have a clear direction or agenda for this blog. I will mostly use this blog to capture things I'm
learning and things I find myself teaching at work.

All things in this blog are my own opinion. If I'm wrong about something, let me know!

This is some code:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

```shell
$> Hello world!
```

This is a screenshot:
